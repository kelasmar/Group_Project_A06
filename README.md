## Executive Summary


In our final group assignment, we will analyze data about Airbnb listings and fit a model to predict the total cost for two people staying 4 nights in an Airbnb in a city. We have chosen Amsterdam for our analysis. 

Our analysis shows that in 95% of the cases, the average price of a 4-night stays for 2 people in a room rate 4.5 or above is between 376$-387$. 

The following variables that can be used to determine the prices impact the price positively:

- The rating of reviews
- The number of bedrooms and the capacity of the rental home (accommodates)
- The room type with hotel rooms and entire apartments
- Super host attracts more clients and can charge a premium
- Highly available rooms positively impact the price. There might be a bigger market for cheap rooms which are less available. 
- Most popular neighborhood positively impacts the price. 

The following variables that can be used to determine the prices impact the price negatively:

- Some Room Types: Private and Shared rooms. These rooms might be smaller, and clients of these rooms (students) might be willing to pay less for a rental unit. The room type with hotel rooms and entire apartments being the most expensive units. 
- The number of reviews. It is likely because clients see a place with a lot of reviews less exclusive. This might also serve as a proxy for total visits (and cheaper places will likely have less visist)

The following variables were not used because they didn’t seem relevant for our models: 
- The property types and number of beds capture the same information as room type and the number of bedrooms. 
- The presence of a license is not relevant.
- Last reviews, compared to the average rating, don’t give additional information. 


Next potential steps:
Using these variables, we were able to explain up to 50% of the price differences. Other variables such as the photos, number of visits, the host presentation can help explain more accurately the price. Areas for further exploration include exploring different cities, seasons in terms of price.
